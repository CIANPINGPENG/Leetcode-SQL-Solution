**Intuition:
The intuition is to calculate the total volume of products stored in each warehouse by merging two tables.

**Algorithm:
I started by selecting the name of the warehouse from Warehouse table, and renamed it as warehouse_name.
Also, I mutiplied the dimensions of the product from the Products table by the number of units of that product from the Warehouse table.
Then, the volumes of all products stored in each warehouse are summed up to get the total volume of products in the warehouse, and renamed it as volume.
I used INNER JOIN to combine two tables because I ignored the information which didn't exist in two tables.
The GROUP BY clause groups the warehouse's name, so that the SUM was aggregated for each unique warehouse.
Then, the final result is a table that shows the warehouse's name and volume.

```
SELECT 
    W.name AS warehouse_name, 
    SUM(P.Width*P.Length*P.Height*W.units) AS volume
FROM Warehouse W
INNER JOIN Products P
    ON W.product_id = P.product_id
GROUP BY W.name
```
