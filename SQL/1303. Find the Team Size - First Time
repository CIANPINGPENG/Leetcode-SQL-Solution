**Intuition:
The intuition is to retrieve the employee IDs and the corresponding team sizes for each employee.

**Algorithm:
1. Retrieve all records from the Employee data.
2. Perform a left join with the derived table.
3. In the subquery, group the records by team ID and calculate the team size using the COUNT function.
4. Match the team IDs in the main table with the team IDs in the subquery to associate each employee with their respective team size.
5. Select the employee IDand team size from the result.

```
SELECT A.employee_id, B.team_size
FROM Employee A
LEFT JOIN 
  (SELECT employee_id, team_id, COUNT(employee_id) AS team_size
  FROM Employee
  GROUP BY team_id
  ) B
  ON A.team_id = B.team_id
```

**Improvement:
Partitioning the data could improve the query's performance.
