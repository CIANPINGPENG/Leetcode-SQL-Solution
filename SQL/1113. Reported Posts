**Intuition:
The intuition is to find out how to filter the data and calculate the total posts.

**Algorithm:
Based on the request, I filtered that the action is report and the date is 2019/7/4.
Also, I used DISTINCT to avoid repetitive post_id as a subquery.
Then, I counted the total posts based on report_reason.
After calculation, I selected two columns I needed, report_reason and report_count

```
SELECT report_reason, COUNT(report_reason) AS report_count
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT extra AS report_reason, post_id
    FROM Actions
    WHERE action = 'report' AND action_date = '2019-07-04'
    ) A
GROUP BY report_reason
```
