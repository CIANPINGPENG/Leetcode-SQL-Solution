**Intuition:
The intuition is to combine two tables and select the columns I want.

**Algorithm:
Because I wanted to keep all the data from Queries,
I used LEFT JOIN to make two tables as one based on id and year.
Then, I selected the three columns I needed, id, year, and npv.
Because I would like the data to show 0 rather than NULL if the id and year from NPV doesn't match Queries table, 
I used IFNULL function if the data is NULL, it shows 0.
I also can use COALESCE funtion to achieve my goal.

```
SELECT Q.id, Q.year, IFNULL(N.npv, 0) AS npv
FROM Queries Q
LEFT JOIN NPV N
    ON Q.id = N.id AND Q.year = N.year
```
