**Intuition:
The intuition is to combine two tables and use CASE statment to identify the weather type.

**Algorithm:
To solve this problem, we need to inner join the Countries and Weather tables using the country_id column.
Then, I filtered the data which is not in November 2019.
After that, I grouped the results by country_id to calculate the average weather_state for each country.
I used CASE statement to determine the type of weather based on the average weather state.
Finally, the result showed two columns, country_name and weather_type.

```
SELECT 
    C.country_name, 
    CASE WHEN AVG(W.weather_state) <= 15 THEN 'Cold'
         WHEN AVG(W.weather_state) >= 25 THEN 'Hot' 
         ELSE 'Warm' END AS weather_type
FROM Countries C
INNER JOIN Weather W
    ON C.country_id = W.country_id
WHERE MONTH(W.day) = 11
GROUP BY W.country_id
```
