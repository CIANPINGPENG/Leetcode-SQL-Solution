**Intuition:
The intuition is to retrieve the name of all sellers who did not have any orders in 2020.

**Algorithm:
A subquery is executed to find all seller IDs that have orders in 2020.
This is achieved by selecting the seller IDs from the Orders table where the sale date has a year equal to 2020.
The outer query retrieves the names of all sellers whose IDs are not included in the result of the subquery.
This is achieved by selecting the seller names from the Seller table where the seller ID is not present in the subquery result by NOT IN operator.
The ORDER BY clause at the end is used to sort the result set in ascending order by the seller name.

```
SELECT seller_name
FROM Seller
WHERE seller_id NOT IN(
    SELECT seller_id
    FROM Orders
    WHERE YEAR(sale_date) = 2020)
ORDER BY seller_name
```
