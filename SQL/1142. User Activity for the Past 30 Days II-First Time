**Intuition:
The intuition is to calculate the average number of sessions per user within a specified date range.

**Algorithm:
1. The inner query selects all rows from the Activity table that fall within the date range.
2. The inner query then groups the rows by user_id and session_id, ensuring that each unique combination is considered as a distinct session for a user.
3. The outer query calculates the average sessions per user and round to two decimal places.

```
SELECT IFNULL(ROUND(COUNT(session_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT user_id),2),0) AS average_sessions_per_user
FROM (
  SELECT *
  FROM Activity
  WHERE activity_date BETWEEN "2019-06-28" AND "2019-07-27"
  GROUP BY user_id, session_id
  ) A
```
