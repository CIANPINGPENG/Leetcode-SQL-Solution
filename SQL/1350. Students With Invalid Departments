**Intuition:
The intuition is to filter employees whose department doesn't in the table.

**Algorithm:
To simplify the solution, I used subquery instead of joining table.
I used the Students table and filter the result set to include only the rows where the deparment_id value didn't show up in the Departments table.
Then, I selected the two columns I needed, id and name from Students table

```
SELECT id, name
FROM Students
WHERE department_id NOT IN (
    SELECT id
    FROM Departments
)
```
