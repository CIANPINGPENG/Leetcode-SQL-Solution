**Intuition:
The intuition is to merge two tables by inner join and filter the data which meets the requirement.

**Algorithm:
Based on the request, I joined Products and Orders tables on the product_id column.
The condition for the join is that the product must have been ordered in February 2020.
So, I used WHERE function to filter that the order_date is between 2020/2/1 and 2020/2/29.
To get the total units ordered for each product, I used GROUP BY the product_id and SUM the unit column.
Then, I filtered the results by the SUM of units being greater than or equal to 100.
After that, I selected two columns I needed, product_name and the SUM of units.

```
SELECT Products.product_name, SUM(Orders.unit) AS unit
FROM Products
INNER JOIN Orders
    ON Products.product_id = Orders.product_id
WHERE Orders.order_date BETWEEN '2020-02-01' AND '2020-02-29'
GROUP BY Orders.product_id
HAVING SUM(Orders.unit) >= 100
```
