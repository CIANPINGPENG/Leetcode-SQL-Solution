**Intuition:
The intuition is to combine two tables and calculate the average of experience years for a project.

**Algorithm:
I merged Project table and Employee table by INNER JOIN based on employee_id because I didn't need to consider these two tables didn't match with each other.
Then, I used AVG to calculate the average of experience years based on projects.
After calculation, I selected the two columns I needed, product_id and average_years.

```
SELECT P.project_id, ROUND(AVG(E.experience_years),2) AS average_years
FROM Project P
INNER JOIN Employee E
    ON P.employee_id = E.employee_id
GROUP BY P.project_id
```
