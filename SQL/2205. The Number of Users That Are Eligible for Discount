**Intuition:
The intuition is to return the count of distinct user IDs from the "Purchase" table satisfying "time_stamp" and "anount" conditions.

**Algorithm:
1. Select the count of distinct user IDs from the "Purchase" table.
2. Use the "Between" operator to check if the "time_stamp" is within the given data range, and the amount is larger than the minAmount.

```
CREATE FUNCTION getUserIDs(startDate DATE, endDate DATE, minAmount INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id))
      FROM Purchases
      WHERE 
        time_stamp BETWEEN startDate AND endDate AND 
        amount >= minAmount
  );
END
```
