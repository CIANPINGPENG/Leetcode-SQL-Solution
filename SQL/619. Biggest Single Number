**Intuition:
The intuition is to calculate how many times a number shows up.
Then, we filter out the number of occurences more than once.
After filtering, we select the biggest one.

**Algorithm:
I used COUNT to calculate a number's occurence times.
Then I used subquery to filter out numbers from appearing just one time by WHERE.
After that, I used MAX to select the biggest one.

```
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT num, COUNT(num) AS CountNum
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    ) M1
WHERE CountNum = 1
```
**Improvement:
Use HAVING to filter out the occurence more than once in the subquery
