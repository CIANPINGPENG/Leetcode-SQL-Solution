**Intuition:
The intuition is to combine two tables and filter the data I want.

**Algorithm:
Because I didn't want the data which could't match,
I used INNER JOIN to make two tables as one based on content_id.
Based on the problem requirement, I filtered the data which program_date was in Jun 2020, content_type is Movies and Kids_content is Yes.
Then, I selected the title columns and use the DISTINCT funtion to ensure that each title is only listed once in the result set.

```
SELECT DISTINCT title
FROM Content C
INNER JOIN TVProgram T
    ON C.content_id  = T.content_id 
WHERE 
    YEAR(T.program_date) = 2020 AND
    MONTH(T.program_date) = 6 AND
    C.content_type = 'Movies' AND
    C.Kids_content = 'Y'
```
