**Intuition:
The intuition is to combine two tables and select the columns I want.

**Algorithm:
Because I wanted to keep all names from Employees table, 
I used LEFT JOIN to make two tables as one based on id.
Then, I selected the two columns I needed, unique_id and name.

```
SELECT unique_id, name
FROM Employees E
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI U
    ON E.id = U.id
```
