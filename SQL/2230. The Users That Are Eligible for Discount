**Intuition:
The intuition is to retrieve distinct user IDs from the "Purchase" table satisfying "time_stamp" and "anount" conditions.

**Algorithm:
1. Select the distinct user IDs from the "Purchase" table.
2. Use the "Between" operator to check if the "time_stamp" is within the given data range, and the amount is larger than the minAmount.
3. Ordered by user_id

```
CREATE PROCEDURE getUserIDs(startDate DATE, endDate DATE, minAmount INT)
BEGIN

	# Write your MySQL query statement below.
	SELECT DISTINCT(user_id)
    FROM Purchases
    WHERE 
        time_stamp BETWEEN startDate AND endDate AND
        amount >= minAmount
    ORDER BY user_id;

END
```
