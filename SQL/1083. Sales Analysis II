**Intuition:
The intuition is to filter out the buyers who buy S8 from those people who buy S8 and iPhone.

**Algorithm:
Because the product_id is not always the same, like S8's product_id is 1 this time, but it may change to 2 next time,
I used INNER JOIN to make two tables as one based on product_id.
Then, I filtered out the customers by product_name.

First, I used WHERE to filter out the customers who buy S8
In the subquery, I filtered the customers who buy iPhone.
Second, I used NOT IN to filter out those people who buy S8 but don't buy iphone by subquery. 
Then, I used DISTINCT to avoid repititive buyer_id

```
SELECT DISTINCT buyer_id
FROM Sales S
INNER JOIN Product P
    ON S.product_id = P.product_id
WHERE 
    P.product_name = 'S8' AND 
    S.buyer_id NOT IN (
        SELECT S.buyer_id
        FROM Sales S
        INNER JOIN Product P
            ON S.product_id = P.product_id
        WHERE P.product_name = 'iPhone'
        ) 
```

**Improvement:
Use no subquery to complete the request
