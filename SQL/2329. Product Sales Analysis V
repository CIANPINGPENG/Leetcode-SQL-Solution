**Intuition:
The intuition is to retrieve the total spending of each user in the sales data.
So, I need to join the Sales table with the Product table and then group the results by user_id.

**Algorithm:
1. Select user IDs and calculate the sum of the product of quantity and price.
2. Perform an inner join on the product_id column to match the sales data with the corresponding product information.
3. Group the data by user_id.
3. Order the results in descending order based on the total spending.

```
SELECT A.user_id, SUM(A.quantity*B.price) AS spending
FROM Sales A
INNER JOIN Product B
    ON A.product_id = B.product_id 
GROUP BY A.user_id
ORDER BY spending DESC
```
