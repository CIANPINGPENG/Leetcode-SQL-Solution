**Intuition:
The intuition is to combine two tables and select the columns I want.

**Algorithm:
Because I didn't want the data which could't match,
I used INNER JOIN to make two tables as one based on product_id.
Then, I selected the three columns I needed, product_name, year, price

```
SELECT P.product_name, S.year, S.price
FROM Sales S
INNER JOIN Product P
    ON S.product_id = P.product_id
```
