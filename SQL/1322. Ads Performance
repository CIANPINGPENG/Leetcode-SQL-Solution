**Intuition:
The intuition is to calculate the ratio of the number of clicks to the number of views for each ad and express it as a percentage.

**Algorithm:
1. Retrieve the ad_id
2. Calculate the the number of rows where the action is "Clicked" and divide it by the number of rows where the action is either "Clicked" or "Viewed".
3. Multiple the result by 100 and round it to two decimal places.
4. If the division results in a NULL value, set the CTR to 0 using IFNULL.
5. Group the results by ad_id.
6. Sort the results in descending order first by CTR and then by ad_id.

```
SELECT ad_id, 
    IFNULL(ROUND((SUM(action="Clicked")/SUM(action="Clicked" OR action="Viewed"))*100,2),0) AS ctr
FROM Ads
GROUP BY ad_id
ORDER BY ctr DESC, ad_id
```
