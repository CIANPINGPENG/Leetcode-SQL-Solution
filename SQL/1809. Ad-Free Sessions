**Intuition:
The intuition is to find all distinct session IDs that did not have any ads played during their playback period.

**Algorithm:
1. Select all distinct session IDs from the playback table where the session ID is not in the subquery.
2. The subquery selects session IDs from the playback table that have a corresponding customer ID in the Ads table, where the ad was played during the sessions's playback period.

```
SELECT DISTINCT session_id
FROM Playback 
WHERE session_id NOT IN(
    SELECT A.session_id
    FROM Playback A
    INNER JOIN Ads B
        ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
    WHERE B.timestamp BETWEEN A.start_time AND A.end_time
)
```
