**Intuition:
The intuition is to select data from the Orders table, which includes information about orders made by customers, such as the order date and customer ID.
The query groups the data by month and calculate the number of orders and the number of unique customers who made those orders.

**Algorithm:
I selected three columns from the Orders table.
I formatted the order_data column to only show the year and month in number, and renamed it to month.
The COUNT function is used to calculate the total number of orders for each month, and the number of unique customers who made those orders.
I used WHERE clause filters out orders where the invoice is less than or equal to $20.
The GROUP BY clause groups the data by month, so that the counts are aggregated for each unique month.
Then, the final result is a table that shows the month, the number of orders made in that month, and the number of unique customers who made those orders.

```
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(order_date,'%Y-%m') AS month, 
    COUNT(customer_id) AS order_count, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM Orders
WHERE invoice > 20
GROUP BY month
```
