**Intuition:
The intuition is to select distinct artists from the Spotify table and counts the number of occurrences of each artist.

**Algorithm:
1. Select distinct artist names from the Spotify table.
2. Count the occurrences of each artist using the COUNT function and alias it as "occurrences".
3. Group the results by the artist.
4. Order the results first by the occurrences in descending order and then by artist name in ascending order.

```
SELECT DISTINCT artist, COUNT(artist) AS occurrences
FROM Spotify
GROUP BY artist
ORDER BY occurrences DESC, artist 
```
