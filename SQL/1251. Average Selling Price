**Intuition:
The intuition is to calculate the average price of each product based on the prices and units sold.

**Algorithm:
1. Perform an inner join between the Prices table and the UnitsSold table on the product ID, matching the purchase date between the start date and end date.
2. Group the results by the product ID.
3. Calculate the sum of price multiple by units for each product ID and the sum of units for each product ID.
   Then, get the average price.
4. Round the average price to two decimal places. 

```
SELECT 
  A.product_id AS product_id, 
  ROUND(SUM(A.price*B.units)/SUM(B.units),2) AS average_price
FROM Prices A
INNER JOIN UnitsSold B
    ON A.product_id = B.product_id AND 
       B.purchase_date BETWEEN A.start_date AND A.end_date
GROUP BY A.product_id
```
