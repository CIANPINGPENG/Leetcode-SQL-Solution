**Intuition:
The intuition is to search for all customer IDs whose revenue in the year 2021 is greater than 0.

**Algorithm:
1. Select the customer_id column to retrieve
2. Use WHERE statement to specify the conditions for filtering the data, which is year 2021 and positive revenue

```
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customers
WHERE 
  year = 2021 AND 
  revenue > 0
```
