**Intuition:
The intuition is to retrieve data where the bonus is either missing (NULL) or less than 1000.

**Algorithm:
1. Select name from the Employee table and bonus from the Bonus table.
2. Use LEFT JOIN to combine the Employee and Bonus tables based on the employee ID.
3. Filter if an employee doesn't have a bonus entry or bonus is less than 1000 in the Bonus table

```
SELECT 
    A.name, 
    B.bonus
FROM Employee A
LEFT JOIN Bonus B
    ON A.empId = B.empId
WHERE 
    B.bonus IS NULL OR 
    B.bonus < 1000
```
