**Intuition:
The intuition is to calculate the total quantity sold for a product.

**Algorithm:
Because the columns I needed, product_id and quantity, are in the Sales table,
it is not necessary for me to combine two tables.
Therefore, I used GROUP BY and SUM to sum up the quantity based on the product_id.
Then, I selected the two columns I needed, product_id and total_quantity.

```
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity 
FROM Sales
GROUP BY product_id
```
