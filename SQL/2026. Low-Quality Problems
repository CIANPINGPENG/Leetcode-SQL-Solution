**Intuition:
The intuition is to retrieve the problem IDs where the ratio of likes to the total number of votes is less than 0.6.

**Algorithm:
1. Select the problem_id column from the Problems table.
2. Filter the rows based on the condition that the ratio of likes to the total number of votes is less than 0.6.
3. Arrange the problem_id column in ascending order.

```
SELECT problem_id
FROM Problems
WHERE likes / (likes+dislikes) < 0.6
ORDER BY problem_id
```
